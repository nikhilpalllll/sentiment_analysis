Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind textual data, particularly in product reviews. This project, submitted by Nikhil Pal, explores the application of the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier for automatically categorizing customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The study focuses on e-commerce product reviews, leveraging machine learning to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

The methodology involves data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal), feature extraction using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, and model training with Multinomial Naive Bayes, a probabilistic algorithm known for its efficiency in text classification. The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving strong performance (~85-90% accuracy) in sentiment prediction.
